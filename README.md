# Aurora Notes Mobile üì±

> A beautiful and intuitive note-taking mobile application built with React Native

## About This Project

Welcome to **Aurora Notes Mobile** - my personal note-taking app that combines elegant design with powerful functionality. This project represents my journey in mobile app development, showcasing modern React Native practices and thoughtful user experience design.

### Why I Built This

As someone who values organization and creativity, I wanted to create a note-taking app that goes beyond simple text storage. Aurora Notes Mobile is designed to be your digital companion for capturing thoughts, ideas, and memories with style and efficiency.

## Features ‚ú®

- üìù **Rich Text Editing** - Create beautiful notes with formatting options
- üé® **Customizable Themes** - Personalize your experience
- üîç **Smart Search** - Find your notes instantly
- üì± **Cross-Platform** - Works seamlessly on iOS and Android
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Sync & Backup** - Your notes are always safe and accessible

## Screenshots üì∏

## My Vision for This App

I believe that taking notes should be a delightful experience, not a chore. Aurora Notes Mobile is designed to inspire creativity and help you capture your thoughts in the most intuitive way possible. Every pixel has been carefully considered to create an app that you'll love to use every day.

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes ‚Äî¬†this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Development Journey üöÄ

This project is a testament to my passion for mobile development and user experience design. I've carefully crafted each component to ensure both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

### Technologies Used

- **React Native** - Cross-platform mobile development
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Redux** - State management
- **React Navigation** - Navigation solution
- **Native Modules** - Platform-specific features

### My Development Process

1. **Planning & Design** - Wireframing and user flow design
2. **Architecture** - Setting up scalable project structure
3. **Implementation** - Building core features with attention to detail
4. **Testing** - Ensuring reliability across devices
5. **Polish** - Refining user experience and performance
